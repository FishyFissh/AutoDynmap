# AutoDynmap
AutoDynmap automatically fullrenders Dynmap when there are no players online and cancelrenders when a player joins.

This is useful for small private creative Minecraft servers which is what I designed this for.
By only rendering when there are no players online, this ensures that the fullrender will capture all of the changes made.
